Implementation of concurrent prmitives and data structure in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## Current state
The library is under development and research.
In most cases the lib structures use as guinea pigs for [Benchmark harness](https://github.com/japaric/criterion.rs) and
[Unit test harness](https://github.com/reem/stainless).
Also the library is missing concurrent stress tests.

Currently this library is missing:
* concurrent bencmarks
* concurrent stress tests
